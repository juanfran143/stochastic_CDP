## Introduction

This project is designed to solve the Stochastic Capacitated Dispersion Problem using a Forward-Backward Simheuristic algorithm. It aims to provide robust solutions under stochastic conditions, outperforming traditional heuristic methods by integrating simulation techniques with metaheuristics.

## Code structure

The active implementation lives in the `CDP` package and is composed of the instance loader, construction heuristics, tabu-inspired local searches, the simheuristic evaluators, and the `Main.py` runner. Legacy prototype modules that duplicated this logic (`Algorithms.py` and `statistics.py`) have been removed to keep the repository focused on the maintained workflow.
