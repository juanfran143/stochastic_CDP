## Introduction

This project is designed to solve the Stochastic Capacitated Dispersion Problem using a Forward-Backward Simheuristic algorithm. It aims to provide robust solutions under stochastic conditions, outperforming traditional heuristic methods by integrating simulation techniques with metaheuristics.
